/* collection is a interface .where it can store unlimited  data like array. But array has limited memory
  exmaple  arr[] a = new arr[4]
  That's why we use collections.
  collection is a interface it extends List. List is a interface ,it implemented by ArrayList
  generic means which type collections are using.<class>

  syntax: Collection<Integer> value = new ArrayList<Integer>();
  we have 1:collections
          2:List   List<Double> value = new ArrayList<Double>();
          3:Set    set<String> value = new

   important:
             List list = new ArrayList(); // before generics
             List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();// after genric assigned like these.
               generics are class example: Integer,Double,String are classes.
